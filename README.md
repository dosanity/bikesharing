# Bikesharing

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze Citi bike data from New York City to showcase different visualizations and answer questions on bike sharing. We will be using Python to clean the data and Tableau, a powerful interactive data analytics and visualizations tool that provides easy to understand dashboards, to illustrate different charts. We will then use our analysis to propose a bike-sharing program in cities.

## Resources

+ Data Source: [Citi Bike NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
+ Software: Python 3.20, Tableau

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users
As we can see from the chart below, almost all bikes are checked out for less than one hour and the duration for most of the bike rides is around 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
This next chart visualizes the checkout times for each gender. The orange line represents male riders, the blue line represents female riders, and the red line represents unknown genders. We can see that a majority of bikes are checked out by male riders.

### Trips by Weekday for each Hour
Most people use the Citi bikes during commuting hours on the weekdays. The morning commute is between 6am - 9 am and the afternoon commute is between 4pm - 7pm. On the weekends, the number of rides increase midday and stays consistent throughout the day.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Both male and female riders have similar trends. Most tend to use the Citi bikes during commuting hours on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends. There doesn't seems to be a trend for the unknown variable due to the lack of data.
