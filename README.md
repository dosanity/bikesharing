# Bikesharing

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze Citi bike data from New York City to showcase different visualizations and answer questions on bike sharing. We will be using Python to clean the data and Tableau, a powerful interactive data analytics and visualization tool that provides easy-to-understand dashboards, to illustrate different charts. We will then use our analysis to propose a bike-sharing program in cities.

## Resources

+ Data Source: [Citi Bike NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
+ Software: Python 3.20, Tableau

### Checkout Times for Users
As we can see from the chart below, almost all bikes are checked out for less than one hour and the duration for most of the bike rides is around 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
This next chart visualizes the checkout times for each gender. The orange line represents male riders, the blue line represents female riders, and the red line represents unknown genders. We can see that a majority of bikes are checked out by male riders.

### Trips by Weekday for each Hour
Most people use Citi bikes during commuting hours on weekdays. The morning commute is between 6 am - 9 am and the afternoon commute is between 4 pm – 7 pm. On the weekends, the number of rides increases at midday and stays consistent throughout the day.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Both male and female riders have similar trends. Most tend to use Citi bikes during commuting hours on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends. There doesn't seem to be a trend for the unknown variable due to the lack of data.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
This heatmap shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. We can see that most users are subscribers and that male subscribers represent the greatest rider demographic.

### Top Starting Locations
The visualization below illustrates the top bike stations in the city for starting a journey. We see that the top starting locations are clustered in the downtown area of New York with the larger symbols on the map representing the more popular locations.

### August Peak Hours
From the chart below, we can see that the afternoon commuting hours have a higher number of Citi bike usage during the month of August. Most people use the Citi bikes between 5 pm – 6 pm.

## Summary

From the visualizations created in Tableau, we can conclude that:

+ The Citi bikes are mostly used during commuting hours on the weekdays and throughout the day on the weekends. 
+ There are more male riders than female riders.
+ The trip duration of the bikes is less than 10 minutes.
+ Most of the bikes will be used in the downtown area of the city.

Recommended Visualizations:

+ A graph to visualize the number of trips by each age group.
+ A bar chart to determine which month yields the greatest number of riders.
